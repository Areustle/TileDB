# Benchmarking TileDB

This codebase contains scripts to generate synthetic arrays and compare run
times of load/read queries in TileDB array storage manager, HDF5, SciDB and
Vertica. Scripts are organized in the corresponding folders. Use the README
provided there to learn more about their usage. The 'datagen' folder contains
